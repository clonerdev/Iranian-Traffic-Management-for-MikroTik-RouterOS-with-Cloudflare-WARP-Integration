# Iranian Traffic Management for MikroTik RouterOS with Cloudflare WARP Integration

# Purpose:
The purpose of executing this code or configuration is to manage traffic routing on a MikroTik RouterOS device. Specifically, the configuration aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Routing Through Cloudflare WARP**:
   - Directing non-Iranian IP addresses to pass through Cloudflare WARP for enhanced security and privacy.

2. **Direct Routing for Iranian IP Addresses**:
   - Routing Iranian IP addresses directly without passing through Cloudflare WARP, ensuring efficient and unobstructed access for local traffic.

3. **Regular Update of Iranian IP Address List**:
   - Automatically updating the list of Iranian IP addresses at regular intervals, typically every 24 hours, to ensure accuracy and relevance in network filtering and routing.

4. **System Tray Status Indicator**:
   - Adding a system tray button to conveniently monitor the status of Cloudflare WARP configuration, indicating whether it's enabled or disabled.

# Function Explanation:
The provided code defines a function named `update_iran_ip_list`, responsible for managing the list of Iranian IP addresses. Here's how the function operates:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - It initializes local variables to store the URL of the GitHub repository containing Iranian IP addresses and the temporary file name for data retrieval.

2. **Fetching and Updating Iranian IP Addresses**:
   - It retrieves the latest list of Iranian IP addresses from the specified GitHub repository using the `/tool fetch` command.
   - The function removes any existing records of Iranian IP addresses and updates the firewall address list (`Iran_IPs`) with the new addresses fetched from the repository.

3. **Cleanup**:
   - It removes the temporary file created during the update process to maintain system cleanliness.

# Execution of the Function:
After defining the function, the code executes `update_iran_ip_list` to ensure the Iranian IP address list is up-to-date.

# Routing Settings and Other Configurations:
Following the function execution, the code may include additional configurations related to routing settings and firewall rules tailored to the specific network requirements. These configurations facilitate efficient traffic management and network security.

# System Tray Button:
Lastly, the code adds a system tray button to provide users with a visual indicator of the Cloudflare WARP configuration status, allowing easy monitoring and management of the network setup.

This comprehensive explanation outlines the intended goals and functionality of the provided code or configuration. Adjustments can be made as needed to suit specific network environments and requirements.
